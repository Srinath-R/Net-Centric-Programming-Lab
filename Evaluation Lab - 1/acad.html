            <h1>Academic Achievement</h1>
            <p>Academic performance or "academic achievement" is the extent to which a student, teacher or institution has 
                attained their short or long-term educational goals. Completion of educational benchmarks such as secondary 
                school diplomas and bachelor's degrees represent academic achievement.
            </p>

                Academic achievement is commonly measured through examinations or continuous assessments but there is no general
agreement on how it is best evaluated or which aspects are most importantâ€”procedural knowledge such as skills
or declarative knowledge such as facts.[1] Furthermore, there are inconclusive results over which individual
factors successfully predict academic performance, elements such as test anxiety, environment, motivation, 
and emotions require consideration when developing models of school achievement. Now, schools are receiving 
money based on its students academic achievements. A school with more academic achievements would receive 
more money than a school with less achievements.

            <p>In California, the achievement of schools is measured by the Academic Performance Index.</p>
