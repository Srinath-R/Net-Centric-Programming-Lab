            <h1>Cultural Achievement</h1>
            <p>According to D. H. Feldman “There exist domains of knowledge that all individuals within a
                given culture are expected to acquire. .... The expectation is that every child in the cultural group
                should be able to achieve a certain level of mastery of the designated domains although not
                necessarily the highest level in each" (1985, p. 9). “... cultural environmental conditions are
                different from universal conditions in that they are created, husbanded [taken care of], preserved
                and passed on by members of a culture" (Feldman, 1985, p. 17). In general, cultural
                achievements are those taught informally within a culture, through socialization, as opposed to
                achievements mastered formally through schooling. </p>
             
            <p>Cultural expectations differ from culture to culture and from era to era. Some examples of
                cultural skills expected in most of the United States today include speaking English, handling
                money, and using a telephone. In the predominately rural culture of early 19th United States,
                milking cows, sewing, and chopping firewood were common cultural expectations. In traditional
                rainforest cultures, building shelters from leaves and branches, identifying edible plants, and
                following animal trails are cultural achievements passed on to children as they grow up as
                members of their culture
